# E-Commerce-Back-End

## Description
Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:
- Internet retail, otherwise known as **e-commerce**, is the largest sector of the electronics industry, generating an estimated $29 trillion in 2019. Platforms like Shopify and WooCommerce provide a suite of services to business of all sizes.
- Due to the growing prevelence of such platforms, understanding the fundamental architecture is important for any full-stack web devleoper
- The task was to build the back-end for an e-commerce site by modifying given starter code, by configuring a working Express.js API to use Sequelize to interact with the MySQL database.
- I learned about the importance of having separate files to keep code clean.  Working with seeds, routes and models, I was able to successfully create and "seed" my database with the necessary information, which can be a huge help when working on back or front ends separately, enabling a more seemless integration of the two when ready!
